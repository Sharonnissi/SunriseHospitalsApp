This project is a frontend hospital web application that I built as part of my Technical Control Document showcase. The goal was not just to create a hospital appointment system, but to demonstrate how I apply version control best practices in a real-world style workflow.

By using branch protection rules, pull requests, merge/rebase workflows, and conflict resolution, this project simulates the way professional teams manage and secure their codebases.

---->Purpose of the Project

To showcase my understanding of Git/GitHub workflows as they would be used in a team/project environment.

To simulate how a technical control document would ensure proper governance (branching strategy, reviews, merges, and reverts).

To build a clean, functional web app frontend (hospital banner + appointment form) as the working example.
